The CryptoClustering assignment focused on using K-means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in unsupervised machine learning. Python and unsupervised learning are used to predict whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

# Steps:
**Prepare the Data**
- `StandardScalar` and `scikit-learn` were used to normalize the data from the CVS file.
- A dataframe was then created with the scaled data, and the index was set `coin_id` from the original dataframe as the index of the new dataframe.

**Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame**
- The elbow method was used to find the best value for `k.` Based on the Elbow Curve, the optimal k value was 4 for the given data.

**Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data**
- The original scaled dataframe was used to cluster the cryptocurrency for the best value for k.

**Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis**
- The original scaled dataframe was used to perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components. The total explained variance of the three principal components is approximately 90%.

**Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data**
- The elbow method was used on the PCA data to find the best value for k. Based on this Elbow Curve, it looks like `k=4` is still the correct one. There is no difference between this k value (using the PCA data) and the k value found using the original data.

**Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data**
- The cryptocurrencies were clustered for the best value for k on the PCA data.
